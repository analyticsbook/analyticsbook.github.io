# Chapter 9. Pragmatism: Experience \& Experimental {-}

## Overview {-}

Chapter 9 is about *pragmatism*. Pragmatism is an interesting word because, sometimes, being pragmatic means the opposite of "*-ism*". Read what was said about pragmatism: "*Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".^[Peirce, C. S., \textit{How to Make Our Ideas Clear}, Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, 286–302, 1878.]* In a sense, this resonates with "*why by their fruits you shall know them*."^[Matthew 7:20.] To analyze a dataset, we shall be aware of a tendency that we often apply concepts before we see the dataset. EDA has provided a practical way to help us see our preconceptions. In this chapter, two more methods are presented, including the **kernel regression model**  that generalizes the idea of linear regression, and the **conditional variance regression model**  that creates a convolution by using regression twice. 

## Kernel regression model {-}
### Rationale and formulation {-}

Simple models, similar to the linear regression model, are like *parents who tell white lies*. A model is simple, not only in the sense that it looks simple, but also because it builds on assumptions that simplify reality. Among all the simple models, the linear regression model is particularly good at disguising its simplicity---it seems so natural that we often forget that its simplicity is its assumption. Simple in its cosmology, not necessary in its terminology---that is what the phrase *simple model* means^[In this sense, a model, regardless of how sophisticated its mathematical representation is, is a simple model if its assumptions simplify reality to such an extent that demands our leap of faith.].

 

```{r f9-1, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="49%",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center', fig.margin=FALSE, fig.cap="(Left) A single outlier (a local pattern) could impact the regression model as a whole; (right) a *localized* regression model (i.e., the curvature adapts to the locality instead of following a prescribed global form such as a straight line) " } 
 knitr::include_graphics(c('graphics/9_1_left.png','graphics/9_1_right.png'),dpi = 300)   
``` 

"*Simple, but not simpler*" said Albert Einstein. 

One such assumption the linear regression model has made, obviously, is *linearity*. It would be OK in practice, as Figure \@ref(fig:f2-2) in **Chapter 2** assures us: it is not perfect but it is a good approximation. 

Now let's look at Figure \@ref(fig:f9-1) (left). The *true model*, represented by the black line, is truly a line. But the fitted model, the orange line, deviates from the black line. In other words, even if the linearity assumption is correct, the consequence is not what we hope for. 

The troublemaker appears to be the outlier located on the upper right corner of the figure. As discernible data scientists, we should be aware that the *model* is general, while the *dataset* at hand is particular. It is OK to say the outlier is the troublemaker, but note that this outlier is accidental. The real troublemaker is what *enables* the possibility of outlier to be a troublemaker. The real troublemaker lies deeper.

A common theme of the methods in this book is to establish certainty in a world of uncertainty. The linearity assumption is an assumption, since real data rarely give you a perfect straight line. The way it deals with uncertainty is to use the least squares principle for model estimation. It aims to look for a line that could pierce through *all* the data points. This makes each data point have a *global* impact: mentally move any data point in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-1) (left) up and down and imagine how the fitted orange line would move up and down accordingly. In other words, as a data point in any location could change the line dramatically, the linear regression model, together with its least squares estimation method, has imposed an even stronger assumption than merely linearity: it assumes that knowledge learned from one location would be universally useful to all other locations. This implicit assumption^[I.e., models that have made this assumption are often termed as *global models*.] could be irrational in some applications, where the data points collected in one location may only tell information about that local area, not easily generalizable to the whole space. Thus, when the global models fail, we need *local models*^[A *local model* more relies on the data points in a neighborhood to build up the part of the curve that comes through that particular neighborhood.] to fit the data, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-1) (right).



### Theory and method {-}

Suppose there are $N$ data points, denoted as, $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)$ for $n=1,2, \dots, N$. To predict on a point $x^*$, a *local model* assumes the following structure

 

\begin{equation}
\small
    y^* = \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_n w(x_n, x^*).
(\#eq:9-kr)
\end{equation}

Here, $w(x_n,x^*)$ is the **weight function** that characterizes the *similarity* between $x^*$ and the training data points, $x_n$, for $n=1,2,\dots,N$. The idea is to predict on a data point based on the data points that are nearby. Methods differ from each other in terms of how they define $w(x_n,x^*)$.

Roughly speaking, there are two main methods. One is the **K-nearest neighbor**  (**KNN**) smoother, and another is the **kernel** smoother.

*The KNN smoother.* The KNN smoother defines $w(x_n,x^*)$ as

\begin{equation*}
\small
  w\left(x_{n}, x^{*}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}{\frac{1}{k}, \text { if } x_{n} \text { is one of the } k \text { nearest neighbors of } x^{*}}; \\ {0, \text { if } x_{n} \text { is NOT among the } k \text{ nearest neighbors of } x^{*}}.\end{array}\right. 
\end{equation*}

Here, to define the *nearest neighbors* of a data point, a *distance function* is needed. Examples include the *Euclidean*^[E.g., $d\left(\boldsymbol{x}_n, \boldsymbol{x}_m\right)   = \sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{p}  \left( x_{ni}-x_{mi}\right)^2 }$.], *Mahalanobis*, and *Cosine* distance functions. What distance function to use depends on the characteristics of the data. Model selection methods such as the cross-validation can be used to select the best distance function for a dataset. 

  

```{r f9-knn, echo=FALSE,out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.margin=FALSE, fig.cap="Three KNN smoother models ($k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=6$)" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_knn_illu.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

Consider a data example as shown in Table \@ref(tab:t9-knn). A visualization of the data points is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-knn), i.e., the gray data points.



```{r t9-knn, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    data = rbind(
	 c("$1$ " , " $0$ " , " $1$  ")
	,c("$2$ " , " $1$ " , " $3$  ")
	,c("$3$ " , " $2$ " , " $5$  ")
	,c("$4$ " , " $3$ " , " $6$  ")
	,c("$5$ " , " $4$ " , " $9$  ")
	,c("$6$ " , " $5$ " , " $10$  ")
	)
    colnames(data) = c("ID ", "  $x$ ", " $y$ ")
    knitr::kable(data, 
    caption = 'Example of a dataset with $6$ data points',
    booktabs = TRUE,escape = FALSE)
```
                    

Let's build $3$ KNN smoother models (e.g., $k=1$, $k=2$, and $k=6$) and use the Euclidean distance function to identify the *nearest neighbors* of a data point. Results are presented in Tables \@ref(tab:t9-knnK1), \@ref(tab:t9-knnK2), and \@ref(tab:t9-knnK6), respectively. Note that, in this dataset, as there are in total $6$ data points, the KNN model with $k=6$ is the same as the trivial model that uses the average of $y$ as predictions for all data points. 



```{r t9-knnK1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    data = rbind(
	 c("$0.4$ " , " $x_1$ " , " $y_1$  ")
	,c("$1.6$ " , " $x_3$ " , " $y_3$  ")
	,c("$3.2$ " , " $x_4$ " , " $y_4$  ")
	,c("$4.8$ " , " $x_6$ " , " $y_6$  ")
	)
    colnames(data) = c("$x^*$ ", " KNN ", " $y^*$ ")
    knitr::kable(data, 
    caption = 'Predictions by a KNN smoother model with $k=1$ on some locations of $x^*$',
    booktabs = TRUE,escape = FALSE)
```
                    



```{r t9-knnK2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    data = rbind(
	 c("$0.4$ " , " $x_1$, $x_2$ " , " $(y_1 + y_2)/2$  ")
	,c("$1.6$ " , " $x_2$, $x_3$ " , " $(y_2 + y_3)/2$  ")
	,c("$3.2$ " , " $x_4$, $x_5$ " , " $(y_4 + y_5)/2$  ")
	,c("$4.8$ " , " $x_5$, $x_6$ " , " $(y_5 + y_6)/2$  ")
	)
    colnames(data) = c("$x^*$ ", " KNN ", " $y^*$ ")
    knitr::kable(data, 
    caption = 'Predictions by a KNN smoother model with $k=2$ on some locations of $x^*$',
    booktabs = TRUE,escape = FALSE)
```
                    



```{r t9-knnK6, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    data = rbind(
	 c("$0.4$ " , " $x_1$-$x_6$ " , " $\\sum_{n=1}^{6} y_n/6$  ")
	,c("$1.6$ " , " $x_1$-$x_6$ " , " $\\sum_{n=1}^{6} y_n/6$  ")
	,c("$3.2$ " , " $x_1$-$x_6$ " , " $\\sum_{n=1}^{6} y_n/6$  ")
	,c("$4.8$ " , " $x_1$-$x_6$ " , " $\\sum_{n=1}^{6} y_n/6$  ")
	)
    colnames(data) = c("$x^*$ ", " KNN ", " $y^*$ ")
    knitr::kable(data, 
    caption = 'Predictions by a KNN smoother model with $k=6$ on some locations of $x^*$',
    booktabs = TRUE,escape = FALSE)
```
                    

The $3$ KNN smoother models are also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-knn).


A distinct feature of the **KNN smoother** is the *discrete* manner to define the similarity between data points, which is, for any data point $x^*$, the data point $x_n$ is either a neighbor or not. The KNN smoother only uses the $k$ nearest neighbors of $x^*$ to predict $y^*$. This discrete manner of the KNN smoother results in the serrated curves shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-knn). This is obviously artificial, pointing out a systematic *bias* imposed by the KNN smoother model.

*The kernel smoother.* To remove this bias, the **kernel smoother** creates *continuity* in the similarity between data points. A kernel smoother defines $w(x_n,x^* )$ in the following manner

\begin{equation*}
\small
  w\left(x_{n}, x^{*}\right)=\frac{K\left(x_{n}, x^{*}\right)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} K\left(x_{n}, x^{*}\right)}. 
\end{equation*}

Here, $K\left(x_{n}, x^{*}\right)$ is a *kernel function* as we have discussed in **Chapter 7**. There have been many kernel functions developed, for example, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:t9-1).



```{r t9-1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    data = rbind(
	 c("Line " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = \\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\\boldsymbol{x}_j$ " , " *null* ")
	,c("Polynomial " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j)= \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\\boldsymbol{x}_j + 1\\right)^q$ " , " $q$")
	,c("Gaussian radial basis " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = e^{-\\gamma\\Vert \\boldsymbol{x}_i  - \\boldsymbol{x}_j\\Vert^2}$ " , " $\\gamma \\geq 0$")
	,c("Laplace radial basis " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = e^{-\\gamma\\Vert \\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_j\\Vert}$ " , " $\\gamma \\geq 0$")
	,c("Hyperbolic tangent " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = tanh(\\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\\boldsymbol{x}_j+b)$ " , " b ")
	,c("Sigmoid " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = tanh(a\\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\\boldsymbol{x}_j+b)$ " , " a,b")
	,c("Bessel function " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j) = \\frac{bessel_{v+1}^n(\\sigma\\Vert \\boldsymbol{x}_i - \\boldsymbol{x}_j \\Vert)}{\\left(\\Vert \\boldsymbol{x}_i -\\boldsymbol{x}_j \\Vert\\right)^{-n(v+1)}}$ " , " $\\sigma, n,v$")
	,c("ANOVA radial basis " , " $K(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_j)  = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-\\sigma\\left(x_i^k - x_j^k\\right)}\\right)^d$ " , " $\\sigma, d$")
	)
    colnames(data) = c("**Kernel Function** ", " **Mathematical Form** ", " **Parameters**")
    knitr::kable(data, 
    caption = 'Some kernel functions used in machine learning',
    booktabs = TRUE,escape = FALSE)
```
                    

Many kernel functions are smooth functions. To understand a kernel function, using R to draw it is a good approach. For example, the following R code draws a few instances of the *Gaussian radial basis* kernel function and shows them in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-gauss). The curve illustrates how the similarity *smoothly* decreases when the distance between the two data points increases. And the *bandwidth* parameter $\gamma$ controls the rate of decrease, i.e., the smaller the $\gamma$, the less sensitive the kernel function to the *Euclidean* distance of the data points (measured by $\Vert \boldsymbol{x}_i  - \boldsymbol{x}_j\Vert^2$).

 

```{r f9-gauss, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Three instances of the *Gaussian radial basis* kernel function ($\\gamma=0.2$, $\\gamma=0.5$, and $\\gamma=1$)" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_gauss.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Use R to visualize a kernel function
require(latex2exp) # enable the use of latex in R graphics
# write a function for the kernel function
gauss <- function(x,gamma) exp(- gamma * x^2)
x <- seq(from = -3, to = 3, by = 0.001) 
plot(x, gauss(x,0.2), lwd = 1, xlab = TeX('$x_i  - x_j$'),
     ylab="Gaussian radial basis kernel", col = "black")
lines(x, gauss(x,0.5), lwd = 1, col = "forestgreen")
lines(x, gauss(x,1), lwd = 1, col = "darkorange")
legend(x = "topleft", 
       legend = c(TeX('$\\gamma = 0.2$'), TeX('$\\gamma = 0.5$'),
                  TeX('$\\gamma = 1$')), 
       lwd = rep(4, 4), col = c("black",
                                "darkorange","forestgreen"))
```

### R Lab {-}
*The 6-Step R Pipeline.* **Step 1** and **Step 2** get the dataset into R and organize it in required format. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 1 -> Read data into R workstation

library(RCurl)
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
              "/analyticsbook/book/main/data/KR.csv")
data <- read.csv(text=getURL(url))
# str(data)

# Step 2 -> Data preprocessing
# Create X matrix (predictors) and Y vector (outcome variable)
X <- data$x
Y <- data$y

# Create a training data 
train.ix <- sample(nrow(data),floor( nrow(data) * 4/5) )
data.train <- data[train.ix,]
# Create a testing data 
data.test <- data[-train.ix,]
```


**Step 3** creates a list of models. For a kernel regression model, important decisions are made on the kernel function and its parameter(s). For example, here, we create two models with two kernel functions and their parameters:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 3 -> gather a list of candidate models

# model1: ksmooth(x,y, kernel = "normal", bandwidth=10)
# model2: ksmooth(x,y, kernel = "box", bandwidth=5)
# model3: ...
```

**Step 4** uses cross-validation to evaluate the candidate models to identify the best model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 4 -> Use 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models

n_folds = 10 # number of fold 
N <- dim(data.train)[1] 
folds_i <- sample(rep(1:n_folds, length.out = N)) 

# evaluate model1
cv_mse <- NULL 
for (k in 1:n_folds) {
  test_i <- which(folds_i == k) 
  data.train.cv <- data.train[-test_i, ] 
  data.test.cv <- data.train[test_i, ]  
  require( 'kernlab' )
  model1 <- ksmooth(data.train.cv$x, data.train.cv$y, 
                    kernel = "normal", bandwidth = 10,
                    x.points=data.test.cv[,1]) 
  # (1) Fit the kernel regression model with Gaussian kernel
  # (argument: kernel = "normal") and bandwidth = 0.5; (2) There is
  # no predict() for ksmooth. Use the argument
  # "x.points=data.test.cv" instead. 
  y_hat <- model1$y  
  true_y <- data.test.cv$y  
  cv_mse[k] <- mean((true_y - y_hat)^2) 
}

mean(cv_mse)

# evaluate model2 using the same script above
# ... 
```

The result is shown below

```{r eval=FALSE}
# [1] 0.2605955  # Model1
# [1] 0.2662046  # Model2
```
**Step 5** builds the final model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 5 -> After model selection, use ksmooth() function to 
# build your final model
kr.final <- ksmooth(data.train$x, data.train$y, kernel = "normal",
                    bandwidth = 10, x.points=data.test[,1]) # 

```

**Step 6** uses the final model for prediction.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Step 6 -> Evaluate the prediction performance of your model
y_hat <- kr.final$y  
true_y <- data.test$y   
mse <- mean((true_y - y_hat)^2)    
print(mse)
```

This pipeline could be easily extended to KNN smoother model, i.e., using the `knn.reg` in the `FNN` package.

*Simulation Experiment.* We have created a R script in **Chapter 5** to simulate data from nonlinear regression models. Here, we use the same R script as shown below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Simulate one batch of data
n_train <- 100
# coefficients of the true model
coef <- c(-0.68,0.82,-0.417,0.32,-0.68) 
v_noise <- 0.2
n_df <- 20
df <- 1:n_df
tempData <- gen_data(n_train, coef, v_noise)
```

The simulated data are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3) (i.e., the gray data points). 

  

```{r f9-3, echo=FALSE,out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.margin=FALSE, fig.cap="Kernel regression models with different choices on the *bandwidth* parameter ($\\gamma$) of the Gaussian radial basis kernel function" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_3.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

The following R code overlays the *true* model, i.e., as the black curve, in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot the true model
plot(y ~ x, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
lines(x, X %*% coef, lwd = 3, col = "black")
```

Let's use the kernel regression model to fit the data. We use the *Gaussian radial basis* kernel function, with three different choices of the *bandwidth* parameter ($\gamma$), i.e., ($\gamma = 2$, $\gamma = 5$, $\gamma = 15$). Then we overlay the three fitted kernel regression models in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3) using the following R code.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
lines(ksmooth(x,y, "normal", bandwidth=2),lwd = 3,
      col = "darkorange")
lines(ksmooth(x,y, "normal", bandwidth=5),lwd = 3,
      col = "dodgerblue4")
lines(ksmooth(x,y, "normal", bandwidth=15),lwd = 3,
      col = "forestgreen")
legend(x = "topright",
       legend = c("True function", "Kernel Reg (bw = 2)",
                  "Kernel Reg (bw = 5)", "Kernel Reg (bw = 15)"), 
       lwd = rep(3, 4),
       col = c("black","darkorange","dodgerblue4","forestgreen"), 
       text.width = 32, cex = 0.85)
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3), the *bandwidth* parameter determines how smooth are the fitted curves: the larger the bandwidth, the smoother the regression curve^[Revisit Figure \@ref(fig:f9-gauss) and connect the observations made in both figures, i.e., which one in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-gauss) leads to the smoothest curve in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3) and why?]. 

Similarly, we can use the same simulation experiment to study the KNN smoother model. We build three KNN smoother models with $k=3$, $k=10$, and $k=50$, respectively. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("FNN")
require(FNN)
## Loading required package: FNN
xy.knn3<- knn.reg(train = x, y = y, k=3)
xy.knn10<- knn.reg(train = x, y = y, k=10)
xy.knn50<- knn.reg(train = x, y = y, k=50)
```

Similar to Figure \@ref(fig:f9-3), we use the following R code to draw Figure \@ref(fig:f9-2) that contains the true model, the sampled data points, and the three fitted models.

  

```{r f9-2, echo=FALSE,out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.margin=FALSE, fig.cap="KNN regression models with different choices on the number of nearest neighbors" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_2.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Plot the data
plot(y ~ x, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
lines(x, X %*% coef, lwd = 3, col = "black")
lines(x, xy.knn3$pred, lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
lines(x, xy.knn10$pred, lwd = 3, col = "dodgerblue4")
lines(x, xy.knn50$pred, lwd = 3, col = "forestgreen")
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = c("True function", "KNN (k = 3)",
                  "KNN (k = 10)", "KNN (k = 50)"), 
        lwd = rep(3, 4),
        col = c("black", "darkorange", "dodgerblue4",
                "forestgreen"), 
        text.width = 32, cex = 0.85)
```

Comparing Figures \@ref(fig:f9-3) and \@ref(fig:f9-2), it seems that the curve of the kernel regression model is generally *smoother* than the curve of a KNN model. This observation relates to the *discrete* manner the KNN model employs, while the kernel model uses smooth kernel functions that introduce smoothness and continuity into the definition of the neighbors of a data point (thus no hard thresholding is needed to classify whether or not a data point is a neighbor of another data point). 

With a smaller $k$, the fitted curve by the KNN smoother model is less smooth. This is because a KNN smoother model with a smaller $k$ predicts on a data point by relying on fewer data points in the training dataset, ignoring information provided by the other data points that are considered far away^[What about a linear regression model? When it predicts on a given data point, does it use all the data points in the training data, or just a few local data points?]. 

In terms of model complexity, the smaller the parameter $k$ in the KNN model, the larger the complexity of the model. Most beginners think of the opposite when they first encounter this question.

## Conditional variance regression model {-}

### Rationale and formulation {-}

Another common complication when applying linear regression model in real-world applications is that the variance of the response variable may also change. This phenomenon is called **heteroscedasticity** in regression analysis. This complication can be taken care of by a *conditional variance regression* model that allows the variance of the response variable to be a (usually implicit) function of the input variables. This leads to the following model

 

\begin{equation}
\small
    y=\boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{x}+\epsilon_{\boldsymbol{x}}, \epsilon_{\boldsymbol{x}} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\boldsymbol{x}}),
(\#eq:9-cvr)
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\epsilon_{\boldsymbol{x}}$ modeled as a normal distribution with *varying* variance as a function of $\boldsymbol{x}$.


 

```{r f9-cvr-datamodel, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="The *data-generating mechanism* of a conditional variance regression model" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_cvr_datamodel.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

 

```{r f9-condsigma, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="$\\sigma_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ is a function of $\\boldsymbol{x}$" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_condsigma.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

The conditional variance regression model differs from the regular linear regression model in terms of how it models $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}$, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-cvr-datamodel). In other words, the linear regression model is a special type of the conditional variance regression model, with $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}$ being a fixed constant as the horizontal line shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-condsigma). The conditional variance regression model is a stacked model with one regression model on $y$ and another model on $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}$. The model stacking is a common strategy in statistics to handle multi-layered problems.

### Theory and method {-}

Given a dataset with $N$ data points and $p$ variables

\begin{equation*}
\small
   
\boldsymbol{y}=\left[ \begin{array}{c}{y_{1}} \\ {y_{2}} \\ {\vdots} \\ {y_{N}}\end{array}\right], \boldsymbol{X}=\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}{1} & {x_{11}} & {x_{21}} & {\cdots} & {x_{p 1}} \\ {1} & {x_{12}} & {x_{22}} & {\cdots} & {x_{p 2}} \\ {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} \\ {1} & {x_{1 N}} & {x_{2 N}} & {\cdots} & {x_{p N}}\end{array}\right].
 
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $\boldsymbol y \in R^{N \times 1}$ denotes the $N$ measurements of the outcome variable, and $\boldsymbol{X} \in R^{N \times(p+1)}$ denotes the data matrix that includes the $N$ measurements of the $p$ input variables and one dummy variable that corresponds to the intercept term $\beta_0$. The remaining issue is how to estimate the regression parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. There are two situations: $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}^2$ is known and $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}^2$ is unknown.

\paragraph{Known $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}^2$} The likelihood function is^[Readers can use Eq. \@ref(eq:9-cvr) to derive this likelihood function.]
\begin{equation*}
\small
  -\frac{\pi}{2} \ln 2 \pi-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \log \sigma_{\boldsymbol x_{n}}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\left(y_{n}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{T} \boldsymbol{x}_{n}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\boldsymbol x_{n}}^{2}}. 
\end{equation*}

As we have known $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$, the parameters to be estimated only involve the last part of the likelihood function. Thus, we estimate the parameters that minimize:
\begin{equation*}
\small
  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\left(y_{n}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^{T} \boldsymbol{x}_{n}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\boldsymbol x_{n}}^{2}}. 
\end{equation*}
This could be written in the matrix form as^[$\boldsymbol W$ is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal elements as $\boldsymbol W_{nn}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{\boldsymbol x_n}^2}$.]

 

\begin{equation}
\small
    \min_\beta (\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X \beta})^T\boldsymbol{W}(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X\beta}).
(\#eq:9-condivar-gls)
\end{equation}

This has the same structure as the *generalized least squares (GLS)* problem we have mentioned in **Chapter 3**. To solve this optimization problem, we take the gradient of the objective function in Eq. \@ref(eq:9-condivar-gls) and set it to be zero

\begin{equation*}
\small
  \frac{\partial (\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X} \beta})^T\boldsymbol{W}(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{ X\beta})}{\partial \boldsymbol \beta}=0, 
\end{equation*}

\noindent which gives rise to the equation

\begin{equation*}
\small
  \boldsymbol{X}^T \boldsymbol W (\boldsymbol y - \boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol \beta) = 0. 
\end{equation*}

\hfill \break

This leads to the GLS estimator of $\boldsymbol \beta$

 

\begin{equation}
\small
    \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{WX} )^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol y.
(\#eq:9-gls)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Unknown $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}^2$} A more complicated situation, also a more realistic one, is that we don’t know $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$. If we can estimate $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$, we can reuse the procedure we have developed for the case when we have known $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$. 

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-condsigma), $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$ is a function of $\boldsymbol x$. In other words, it uses the input variables $\boldsymbol x$ to predict a new outcome variable, $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$. Isn't this a regression problem? The problem here is we don't have the "measurements" of the outcome variable, i.e., the outcome variable $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$ is not directly measurable^[Another example of a **latent variable**.]. 

To overcome this problem, we estimate the *measurements* of the latent variable^[I.e., just like what we did in the EM algorithm to estimate $z_{nm}$. See **Chapter 6**.], denoted as $\hat{\sigma}_{\boldsymbol{x}_n}^2$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$. We propose the following steps:

 
 <!-- begin{enumerate} --> 


1\. Initialize $\hat{\sigma}_{\boldsymbol{x}_n}^2$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$ by any reasonable approach (i.e., a trivial but popular approach, randomization).

2\. Estimate $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ using the GLS estimator shown in Eq. \@ref(eq:9-gls), and get $\hat{y}_n=\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}^T \boldsymbol{x}_n$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$.

3\. Derive the residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_n = y_n-\hat{y}_n$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$.

4\. Build a regression model, e.g., using the kernel regression model, to fit $\hat \epsilon$ using $\boldsymbol x$.^[I.e., the training dataset is $\{\boldsymbol x_n, \hat{\epsilon}_n, n=1, 2, \dots, N\}$.]

5\. Predict $\hat{\sigma}^2_{\boldsymbol x_n}$ for $n=1,2,\dots,N$ using the fitted model in Step 4.  

6\. Repeat Steps 2 – 5 until convergence or satisfaction of a stopping criteria^[E.g., fix the number of iterations, or set a threshold for changes in the parameter estimation.]. 
 
 <!-- end{enumerate} --> 


This approach of taking some variables as latent variables and further using statistical estimation/inference to fill in the unseen measurements has been useful in statistics and used in many models, such as the latent factor models, structural equation models, missing values imputation, EM algorithm, Gaussian mixture model, graphical models with latent variables, etc.

### R Lab {-}

*Simulation Experiment.* We simulate a dataset to see how well the proposed iterative procedure works for the parameter estimation when $\sigma_{\boldsymbol x}^2$ is unknown. The simulated data has one predictor and one outcome variable. The true model is

\begin{equation*}
\small
  
  y = 1 + 0.5 x + \epsilon_x, \quad \sigma^2_x = 0.5 + 0.8 x^2.
 
\end{equation*}

We stimulate $100$ data points from this model using the R script shown below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Conditional variance function
# Simulate a regression model with heterogeneous variance
gen_data <- function(n, coef) {
x <- rnorm(100,0,2)
eps <- rnorm(100,0,sapply(x,function(x){0.5+0.8*x^2}))
X <- cbind(1,x)
y <- as.numeric(X %*% coef + eps)
return(data.frame(x = x, y = y))
}
n_train <- 100
coef <- c(1,0.5)
tempData <- gen_data(n_train, coef)
```

 

```{r f9-4, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Linear regression model to fit a heteroscedastic dataset" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_4.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

The simulated data points are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-4), together with the true model (the black line). 

To initialize the iterative procedure of parameter estimation for the conditional variance regression model, we fit a regular linear regression model using the following R code. 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Fit the data using linear regression model (OLS)
x <- tempData[, "x"]
y <- tempData[, "y"]
fit.ols <- lm(y~x,data=tempData)
# Plot the data and the models
x <- tempData$x
X <- cbind(1, x)
y <- tempData$y
plot(y ~ x, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
# Plot the true model
lines(x, X %*% coef, lwd = 3, col = "black")
# Plot the linear regression model (OLS)
lines(x, fitted(fit.ols), lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
legend(x = "topleft", legend = c("True function",
                                 "Linear model (OLS)"), 
lwd = rep(4, 4), col = c("black", "darkorange"),
      text.width = 4, cex = 1)
```

The fitted line is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-4), which has a significant deviation from the true regression model. We use the fitted line as a starting point, i.e., so that we can estimate the residuals^[ Residuals $\hat{\epsilon}_n = y_n-\hat{y}_n$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$.] based on the fitted linear regression model. The estimated residuals are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-5) as grey dots. A nonlinear regression model, the kernel regression model implemented by `npreg()`, is fitted on these residuals and shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-5) as the orange curve. The true function of the variance, i.e., $\sigma^2_x = 0.5 + 0.8 x^2$, is also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-5) as the black curve. 

It can be seen that the residuals provide a good starting point for us to approximate the underlying true variance function. To reproduce Figure \@ref(fig:f9-5), use the following R script.

 

```{r f9-5, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Nonlinear regression model to fit the residuals (i.e., the grey dots)" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_5.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
# Plot the residual estimated from the linear regression model (OLS)
plot(x,residuals(fit.ols)^2,ylab="squared residuals",
     col = "gray", lwd = 2)
# Plot the true model underlying the variance of the
# error term
curve((1+0.8*x^2)^2,col = "black", lwd = 3, add=TRUE)
# Fit a nonlinear regression model for residuals
# install.packages("np")
require(np)
var1 <- npreg(residuals(fit.ols)^2 ~ x)
grid.x <- seq(from=min(x),to=max(x),length.out=300)
lines(grid.x,predict(var1,exdat=grid.x), lwd = 3,
      col = "darkorange")
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = c("True function",
                  "Fitted nonlinear model (1st iter)"), 
       lwd = rep(4, 4), col = c("black", "darkorange"),
       text.width = 5, cex = 1.2)
```

The orange curve shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-5) provides an approach to initialize the iterative procedure of parameter estimation for the conditional variance regression model: to estimate the $\hat{\sigma}_{\boldsymbol{x}_n}^2$ for $n=1, 2, \dots, N$ in Step 1.^[In R, this is done by `fitted(var1)`.] Then, for Step 2, we fit a linear regression model according to Eq. \@ref(eq:9-gls). This is done by the following R code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Fit a linear regression model (WLS) with the weights specified 
# by the fitted nonlinear model of the residuals
fit.wls <- lm(y~x,weights=1/fitted(var1))
plot(y ~ x, col = "gray", lwd = 2,ylim = c(-20,20))
# Plot the true model
lines(x, X %*% coef, lwd = 3, col = "black")
# Plot the linear regression model (OLS)
lines(x, fitted(fit.ols), lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
# Plot the linear regression model (WLS) with estimated 
# variance function
lines(x, fitted(fit.wls), lwd = 3, col = "forestgreen")
legend(x = "topleft", 
       legend = c("True function", "Linear (OLS)", 
                  "Linear (WLS) + estimated variance"), 
       lwd = rep(4, 4), 
       col = c("black", "darkorange","forestgreen"),
       text.width = 5, cex = 1)
```

 

```{r f9-6, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Fit the heteroscedastic dataset with two linear regression models using OLS and GLS (that accounts for the heteroscedastic effects with a nonlinear regression model to model the variance regression)" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_6.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

The new regression model is added to Figure \@ref(fig:f9-4) as the green line, which generates Figure \@ref(fig:f9-6). The new regression model is closer to the true model.

And we could continue this iterative procedure until a convergence criterion is met.

*Real data.* Now let’s apply the conditional variance regression model on the AD dataset. Like what we did in the simulation experiment, we first fit a regular linear regression model, then, use the kernel regression model to fit the residuals, then obtain the estimates of the variances, then estimate the regression parameters using Eq. \@ref(eq:9-gls). The R code is shown below. Results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-8). 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
library(RCurl)
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com",
              "/analyticsbook/book/main/data/AD.csv")
AD <- read.csv(text=getURL(url))

str(AD)
# Fit the data using linear regression model (OLS)
x <- AD$HippoNV
y <- AD$MMSCORE
fit.ols <- lm(y~x,data=AD)
# Fit a linear regression model (WLS) with the weights specified 
# by the fitted nonlinear model of the residuals
var1 <- npreg(residuals(fit.ols)^2 ~ HippoNV, data = AD)         
fit.wls <- lm(y~x,weights=1/fitted(var1))
plot(y ~ x, col = "gray", lwd = 2)
# Plot the linear regression model (OLS)
lines(x, fitted(fit.ols), lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
# Plot the linear regression model (WLS) with estimated variance
# function
lines(x, fitted(fit.wls), lwd = 3, col = "forestgreen")
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = c("Linear (OLS)",
                  "Linear (WLS) + estimated variance"), 
       lwd = rep(4, 4), col = c("darkorange","forestgreen"),
       text.width = 0.2, cex = 1)
```

 

```{r f9-8, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Fit the AD dataset with two linear regression models using OLS and GLS (that accounts for the heteroscedastic effects with a nonlinear regression model to model the variance regression)" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_8.png',dpi = 300)   
``` 

We also visualize the fitted variance functions in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-9) via the following R code.

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Plot the residual estimated from the linear regression 
# model (OLS)
plot(x,residuals(fit.ols)^2,ylab="squared residuals",
     col = "gray", lwd = 2)
# Fit a nonlinear regression model for residuals
# install.packages("np")
require(np)
var2 <- npreg(residuals(fit.wls)^2 ~ x)
grid.x <- seq(from=min(x),to=max(x),length.out=300)
lines(grid.x,predict(var1,exdat=grid.x), lwd = 3,
      col = "darkorange")
lines(grid.x,predict(var2,exdat=grid.x), lwd = 3,
      col = "forestgreen")
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = c("Fitted nonlinear model (1st iter)",
                "Fitted nonlinear model (2nd iter)"), 
                lwd = rep(4, 4),
                col = c( "darkorange", "forestgreen"),
                text.width = 0.25, cex = 1.2)
```


Figure \@ref(fig:f9-9) shows that in the data the heteroscedasticity is significant. Learning the variance function is helpful in this context. First, in terms of the statistical aspect, it improves the fitting of the regression line. Second, knowing the variance function itself is important knowledge in healthcare, e.g., variance often implies unpredictability or low quality in healthcare operations, pointing out root causes of quality problems or areas of improvement.

### Linear regression as a kernel regression model {-}

Let's consider a simple linear regression problem that has one predictor, $x$, and no intercept 

\begin{equation*}
\small
  y=\beta x + \epsilon. 
\end{equation*}

Given a dataset with $N$ samples, i.e., $\{x_n, y_n, n = 1, 2, \ldots, N. \}$, the least squares estimator of $\beta$ is

\begin{equation*}
\small
  \hat{\beta}=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{n} y_{n}\right)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n}^{2}}. 
\end{equation*}

Now comes a new data point, $x^*$. To derive the prediction $y^*$, 

\begin{equation*}
\small
  y^{*} = \hat{\beta}x^{*} =x^{*} \frac{\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n} y_{n}\right)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n}^{2}}. 
\end{equation*}

This could be further reformed as

\begin{equation*}
\small
  y^{*}=\sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n} \frac{x_{n}x^{*}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n}^{2}}. 
\end{equation*}

This fits the form of the kernel regression as defined in Eq. \@ref(eq:9-kr).^[I.e., $w(x_{n},x^{*}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{x_{n}x^{*}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} x_{n}^{2}}.$]

<!-- % Now if we look closely at this formula, we can draw interesting observations how linear regression model works in prediction on a new location using its knowledge on other locations (e.g., the historical data points $(x_i,y_i )$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$). It first evaluates the similarity between the new location with each of the knowing locations, as reflected in $\frac{x_i x^*}{nS_x^2}$, where $x_i x^*$ calculates the similarity and $nS_x^2$ is a normalization factor. Then, the prediction $y^*$ is a weighted sum of $y_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$ while the weight of $y_i$ is proportional to the similarity between $x_i$ and $x^*$. From this perspective, we see linear regression model as a very empirical prediction model that bears the same idea with those lazy learning methods such as k-nearest-neighbor regression model or local regression models. The difference here, in the linear regression model, is that a special similarity measure (i.e., $\frac{x_i x^*}{nS_x^2}$) is used, that means the weight of a data point depends on how far it is from the center of the data, not how far it is from the point at which we are trying to predict. Thus, for this similarity measure to work we need to hope that the underlying model is globally linear. -->

### More about heteroscedasticity {-}

For regression problems, the interest is usually in the modeling of the relationship between the *mean*^[See sidenote 11 and Figure \@ref(fig:f2-lrpred).] of the outcome variable with the input variables. Thus, when there is heteroscedasticity in the data, a nonparametric regression method is recommended to estimate the latent variance, more from a curve-fitting perspective which is to smooth and estimate, rather than a modeling perspective which is to study the relationship between the outcome variable with input variables. But, of course, we can still study how the input variables affect the variance of the response variable explicitly. Specifically, we can use a linear regression model to link the variance of $y$ with the input variables. The iterative procedure developed for the case when $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{x}}^2$ is unknown is still applicable here for parameter estimation.

 <!-- begin{enumerate} --> 


1\. Manually build a kernel regression model with Gaussian kernel with bandwidth parameter $\gamma=1$ using the data shown in Table \@ref(tab:t9-hw-kr), and predict on the data points shown in Table \@ref(tab:t9-hw-kr2). 


```{r t9-hw-kr2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
                    

2\. Follow up on the dataset in Q1. Manually build a KNN regression model with $K = 2$. Predict on the testing data in Table \@ref(tab:t9-hw-kr2). 

```{r f9-sampledcurve, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="The true model and its sampled data points" } 
 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_sampledcurve.png',dpi = 300)   
```
3\. Follow up on the dataset in Q1. Use the R pipeline for KNN regression on this data. Compare the result from R and the result by your manual calculation. 

4\. Follow up on the dataset in Q1. Use the `gausskernel()` function from the R package `KRLS` to calculate the similarity between the data points (including the $6$ training data points and the $3$ testing data points in Tables \@ref(tab:t9-hw-kr) and \@ref(tab:t9-hw-kr2)).

 knitr::include_graphics('graphics/9_linetobesampled.png',dpi = 300)   
```
 

5\. Use the `BostonHousing` dataset from the R package `mlbench`, select the variable `medv` as the outcome, and use other numeric variables as the predictors. Run the R pipeline for KNN regression on it. Use cross-validation to select the best number of nearest neighbor, and summarize your findings. 
 

 

6\. Use the `BostonHousing` dataset from the R package `mlbench` and select the variable `lstat` as the predictor and `medv` as the outcome, and run the R pipeline for kernel regression on it. Try the Gaussian kernel function with its bandwidth parameter taking values as $5, 10, 30, 100$. 

7\. Figure \@ref(fig:f9-sampledcurve) shows a nonlinear model (i.e., the curve) and its sampled points. Suppose that the curve is unknown to us, and our task is to build a KNN regression model with $K=2$ based on the samples. Draw the fitted curve of this KNN regression model. 

8\. Suppose that the underlying model is a linear model, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f9-linetobesampled). To use KNN model to approximate the underlying model, we need samples. Suppose that we could afford sampling $8$ data points. Which locations would you like to acquire samples in order to achieve best approximation of the underlying model using your later fitted KNN model?
